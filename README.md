## Are forms important?
The collection and analysis of data is an essential part of a project, for which the use of forms is an important tool that allows the acquisition of relevant data.
There are some benefits of digital forms such as:
 - Save of time and money
 - Massive reach
 - Eliminate input errors and data loss
 - Flexibility to modify the form

 - TextField
